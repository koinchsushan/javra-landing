        Javra software was founded by our director Frank Möllers in 1999. His
        vision was to develop and support future proof custom business
        applications against a competitive price. During the years clients
        rewarded Javra for their services and Javra built up a good track record
        with their innovative projects. Innovation is the key factor for Javra’s
        success. Since 2006, a dedicated team of talented R&D experts has been
        helping our clients with their cutting-edge projects or technical
        solutions.
